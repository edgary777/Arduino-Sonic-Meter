# Arduino-Sonic-Meter

I wrote this as an experiment to be able to dinamically write in a 4-Digits 7-Segments display with an arduino uno r3.

It is written specifically to write the data obtained from a HC-SR04 Sonic Module but can be easily customized to get data from any source as long as the number is 4 digits or less.

it can only write ints but can be easily modified to write floats.
